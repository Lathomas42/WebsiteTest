            <p class="profile-description">
			<p>Throughout this semester, this course has pushed me to become a better writer in mathematics and physics writing. I have explored different
            writing styles throughout the semester that allowed me to find my strengths and weaknesses as a writer, offering the opportunity to improve myself 
            in those areas of weakness. For a person of my profession, the three key learning goals from this course are to learn how to: Formulate and articulate 
            a stance through and in my writing, write to learn and to communicate what I learn, and reflecting on my writing process and self-assess as a writer.</p>
            
            <p>The first goal, to formulate and articulate a stance through and in my writing, is important to me because with any sort of data analysis I do, I will 
            need to provide in depth analysis of whatever results I find. This analysis requires me to formulate and articulate a stance. This course has helped me in 
            this because this formulation and articulation of a  stance has been central to many of the assignments thus far.</p>
            
            <p>I think that the best example of my writing that expresses this first goal of learning in this course is my Op-ed on Mathematics education. In that essay, 
            I began by expressing the need for a better education in mathematics, followed by an opinionated review of the reason to teach math.  I then provide other 
            sources saying similar things to me or backing my claim. Then, I address a few key problems people have with math, followed by why those problems are mislead 
            and offer solutions to fix these problems. Through this essay, I feel my argument was well founded with outside sources and well articulated points such as, 
            after citing a study done about different ways to teach children math I said, “It is for this reason that math problems are not necessarily about practicality, 
            and never have been. Math is known and always has been known for giving useless, impractical problems to see how students approach a problem they don't already 
            know how to solve.”(Math Op-Ed) This point follows evidence and addresses a counterpoint to my argument, both strengthening my claim and weakening the opposing
            claim.</p>
            
            <p>The second main goal of the course, to write to learn and communicate what I learn, is a very important skill to have because it allows me to write my way
            through a problem.  This skill in combination with the first skill allows me to write a paper without a specific argument in mind and finish the paper with a 
            well formed articulate argument based on the evidence provided in the paper. </p>
            
            <p>I showed my learning of this goal in my most recent essay reviewing modern methods of modularity optimization. I wrote this essay because it is a problem I was
            facing at work, choosing which of the key modularity optimization methods to select. I came into the essay with no preference and I have used a few of the methods 
            with varied results. After writing the essay I had formed a strong preference for the Louvain method. I began the essay with unbiased definitions and introductions 
            to all the methods reviewed. The second part of the essay where the table was included and analysis of the results of the table show that the Louvain method was 
            clearly better than the other methods allowed me to learn with the reader that that method was better than others. This essay allowed me to begin with no opinion 
            on a topic and end with a well founded opinion.</p>
            
            <p>The third main goal of the course for me was to be able to reflect on my writing process and self-assess as a writer. This is an invaluable skill to learn as it 
            allows me to always improve. Acknowledging that I am not a great writer and being able to asses where in my writing I need work is vital in improving myself and my 
            arguments. This is not necessarily profession specific as it pertains to many aspects of life.</p>
            
            <p>The combination of these three goals from this course I feel can further me in my profession whether it be in math, physics or data science. Formulating a stance
            through my writing is a vital skill in presenting any argument through analysis and presentation of evidence, being able to learn through writing is an invaluable way
            to get myself out of any pickle where I am unsure of the correct opinion in an argument. Finally, I am continuing to learn and improve my writing by assessing myself 
            along the way attempting to identify my strengths and weaknesses. </p>

							<p>The first assignment in this course was an analysis of a sample of writing from my profession. The paper I chose was
                            <a href="http://www.barabasilab.com/pubs/CCNR-ALB_Publications/199910-15_Science-Emergence/199910-15_Science-Emergence.pdf"><i>Emergence of Scaling in Random Networks</i></a>
                            by Albert-L&aacuteszl&oacute Barab&aacutesi and R&eacuteka Albert in 1999. I chose this paper because it was a hugely influential paper in
                            Complex Networks which is very related to many projects I do both at work and in classes.</p>
                            
                            <p>Throughout this assignment I attempted to make specific judgements on the authors decisions in his writing by citing key moments in the paper I thought were especially
                            important or controversial. In the early stages of this assignment I did not understand how to make judgements about the author very well, I found myself summarizing the
                            paper instead of making judgements.</p>
                            
                            <p>By the end of the assignment I better understood how to read closely and understand the reasoning behind different choice the author made in writing the paper.
                            This made me a better writer by allowing me to improve my critical reading skills and learn different methods for writing a scientific paper.</p>

							</p> The data for this specific plot was found through Bokeh's easy to access sample data sets. These
							data sets can be accessed by importing <a href="https://github.com/ContinuumIO/bokeh/tree/master/bokeh/sampledata">bokeh.sampledata</a>.
							Using bokeh's sample data is a great way to introduce yourself to data visualization because they have examples

							<p>This assignment's goal was to create a reference document for people in our profession. I chose to make a reference document
                            that allowed readers to learn about 4 different data visualization packages in python. The challenge of this assignment was to 
                            learn how to best display information.</p>
                            
                            <p>In this assignment, the challenge I faced was deciding how to display information in an accurate way without saturating the
                            page with information. I wanted to make my document readable and usable by anyone interested.</p>

Mary is friends with Sue,Bill</pre>

							<p>In this example I used Matplotlib's bar plot function to show a large dataset, all Olympic athletes. Specifically showing how many medals were won in each age group.</p>
							<p>In the bar graph, the different colors represent the breakdown of golds,silvers, and bronzes inside the total amount of medals. This was done by using the fact that in matplotlib,
							the first thing you call to be plotted will be under everything else. So I plotted all medals won as a gold bar plot, then all bronze and silver medals as a silver plot, then all bronze medals
							as a bronze plot.</p>
							<p> The library Numpy was also used in this example. Numpy is a widely used python library that allows very fast calculations using numpy-arrays. Whenever you are working with a large data set, 
							use numpy to speed things up. </p>

							<p>The data used for this example is a free data-set from <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/">Sports Reference</a> who has a large (8618 athlete) dataset for the history of the olympics.</p>
							<p>This data was already formatted in a .xlsx format though I switched it to a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sBPnmjGM20bkQJ_WWroE_iBZEqOUcHhEBPqOVEfr3-0/edit?usp=sharing">.csv type</a> to be easily readable in python.
							The csv was formatted in columns like so:</p>
							<pre>Athlete,Age,Country,Year,Closing Ceremony Date,Sport,Gold Medals,Silver Medals,Bronze Medals,Total Medals</pre>
							<p> Although this was way too much information for what I wanted to do so I only payed attention to the Age and the Medals Columns, ignoring 5 columns.</p>
							<p> There are thousands of free data-sets on-line, this is a great example of one of them but many more can be found in places like <a href="data.gov">data.gov</a>. A word of warning with free data-sets, they often have too much information,
							such as this case, where we ignored many of the columns, The unnecessary information should be thrown away at the start to reduce memory used.</p>

							<p> In this example I used PyQtGraph's ScatterPlotItem() Class which behaves as a normal Scatter Plot should.
							The Plus side for PyQtGraph is that it is fast and deals very well with large Datasets. For this reason I 
							used two large datasets (described in the data tab). Making 4 scatter-plots with the datasets, each scatter plot
							comparing 2 variables (x and y axis) and a third using the color of the nodes.</p>
							<p> The left column of scatter plots are Red Wine comparisons and the Right Column are white wine comparisons.

							are colored according to their quality rating, the scale can be seen in the bottom right graph.</p>

							<p> The data used in this plot are large data-sets downloaded from <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/">UCI's machine learning database</a>,
							they are two datasets, preformatted in csv form. One set is red wine(~1600 entries), one set is white wine(~4900 entries). Both sets are similarly formated into columns according to :</p>
							<pre>"fixed acidity";"volatile acidity";"citric acid";"residual sugar";"chlorides";"free sulfur dioxide";"total sulfur dioxide";"density";"pH";"sulphates";"alcohol";"quality"</pre>
							<p> <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UCI</a> is another place on the internet to get great sets of data for free. This particular set allowed me to compare different qualities 
							of red and white wine to the rating to look at trends. Note that in this example, there were many different comparisons I could have made between qualities. The top comparison seems
							to be a decent comparison because we see a clear trend in rating as we go to higher pH/alchohol content. The bottom plots seem to be poor comparisons because there is no real trend 
							going on.</p>
							<p>Sometimes when you have large sets of data with many different qualities it requires you to hunt around and try some different comparisons or plot types before you get one that has a significant trend.</p>
